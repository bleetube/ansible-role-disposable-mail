# Mail Clients

This is where notes can be collected regarding various mail clients.

* Most apps will only work using port 25, ie. smtp with STARTTLS
* Thunderbird only seems to work using port 465, ie. smtps with submissions

For some light reading, see the [TLS](https://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html) article on postfix.org.

* smtp=25
* smtps=submissions=465
* submission=587
